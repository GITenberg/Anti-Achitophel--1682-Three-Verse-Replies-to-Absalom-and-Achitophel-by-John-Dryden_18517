<p class = "editor">English verse allegory, humorous or serious,
political or moral, has deep roots; a reprint such as the present is
clearly no place for a discussion of the subject at large:<a class =
"tag" name = "tag1" href = "#note1">1</a> it need only be recalled here
that to the age that produced <i>The Pilgrim's Progress</i> the art form
was not new. Throughout his life Dryden had his enemies, Prior and
Montague in their satire of <i>The Hind and the Panther</i>, for
example. The general circumstances under which Dryden wrote <i>Absalom
and Achitophel</i>, familiar enough and easily accessible, are therefore
recalled only briefly below. Information is likewise readily available
on his use of Biblical allegory.<a class = "tag" name = "tag2" href =
"#note2">2</a></p>

<p class = "editor">
We are here concerned with three representative replies to <i>Absalom
and Achitophel</i>: their form, their authors, and details of their
publication. Settle's poem was reprinted with one slight alteration a
year after its first appearance; the <i>Reflections</i> has since been
reprinted in part, Pordage's poem not at all. <i>Absalom Senior</i> has
been chosen because, of the many verse pieces directed against Dryden's
poem, it is of the greatest intrinsic merit and shows the reverse side
of the medal, as it were, to that piece; the second is given, not for
any literary merit it may possess--indeed, from its first appearance it
has been dismissed as of small worth--but rather as a poem
representative of much of the versifying that followed hard on the
Popish Plot and as one that has inspired great speculation as to its
author; the third, in addition to throwing light on the others, is a
typical specimen of the lesser work produced in the Absalom dispute.</p>


<p class = "editor">
The author and precise publication date of the <i>Reflections</i> remain
unidentified. Ascription of the poem to Buckingham rests ultimately on
the authority of Wood's <i>Athenae Oxonienses</i> and on Wood alone, and
we do not know on what evidence he thought it to be Buckingham's; we do
know, however, that Wood was often mistaken over such matters. Sir
Walter Scott in his collected edition of Dryden (1808; IX, 272-5) also
accepted Buckingham as the author, but cited no authority; he printed
extracts, yet the shortcomings of his edition, whatever its convenience,
are well known. The poem has not appeared in any subsequent edition of
Dryden's poems, the latest being the
<span class = "facpage">iv</span>
four volume set (Oxford, 1958); the volume of the California Dryden
relevant to <i>Absalom</i> is still awaited.<a class = "tag" name =
"tag_a" href = "#note_a">A</a> Internal evidence is even more scanty.
Only one passage of the <i>Reflections</i> (sig.&nbsp;D2) may bear on
the matter. Perhaps the "Three-fold Might" (p.&nbsp;7, line&nbsp;11)
refers, not to the poet's "tripartite design" (p.&nbsp;7, line&nbsp;10)
or to the Triple Alliance of England, Holland, and Sweden against France
(1677/8, as in <i>Absalom and Achitophel</i>, line 175) but either to a
treatise which had occasioned some stir in the scientific world some
twenty years previously: "the Delphic problem" proposed by Hobbes to the
Royal Society on the duplication of the cube, which might have come to
the ears of Buckingham as well as to those of the court,<a class = "tag"
name = "tag3" href = "#note3">3</a> or perhaps to the triple confederacy
of Essex, Halifax, and Sunderland.<a class = "tag" name = "tag4" href =
"#note4">4</a> But to the Restoration reader the phrase "Three-fold
Might" would rather have suggested the Triple Alliance, to which Dryden
reverts in <i>The Medal</i> (lines 65-68) when he claims that
Shaftesbury, "thus fram'd for ill, ... loos'd our Triple Hold" on
Europe.<a class = "tag" name = "tag5" href = "#note5">5</a></p>

<p class = "editor">
Evidence against Buckingham's authorship, on the other hand, is
comparatively strong. The piece does not appear in his collected
<i>Works</i> (1704-5). It surely would have been included even though he
had at first wished to claim any credit from its publication and later
have wished to disown it. Little connection, furthermore, will be found
between the <i>Reflections</i> and the rest of his published verse or
with the plays, including <i>The Rehearsal</i>, if the latter be his
alone, which is doubtful.</p>

<p class = "editor">
<i>Poetical Reflections</i> has been ascribed to Edward Howard. W.
Thomas Lowndes in his <i>Bibliographer's Manual</i> (1864; II, 126)
assigned to this minor writer, on the authority of an auction note, the
little collection <i>Poems and Essays, with a Paraphrase on Cicero's
Laelius, or, Of Friendship ... By a Gentleman</i> (1674), and G.
Thorn-Drury, on the equally debatable evidence of an anonymous
manuscript ascription on the title page of his own copy, ascribed the
<i>Poetical Reflections</i> to Howard.<a class = "tag" name = "tag6"
href = "#note6">6</a> An examination of the <i>Poems and Essays</i>,
however, reveals no point of resemblance with our poem. How, then, does
Howard fit into the picture? He was in the rival camp to Dryden and was
a friend of Martin Clifford<a class = "tag" name = "tag7" href =
"#note7">7</a> and of Thomas Sprat, then Buckingham's chaplain: these
three have been thought to be jointly responsible for <i>The
Rehearsal</i>. Sprat had published a poem of congratulation to Howard on
Howard's <i>The British Princes</i> (1669), the latter a long
pseudo-epic
<span class = "facpage">v</span>
of the Blackmore style in dreary couplets which, again, provides no
parallel with the <i>Reflections</i>. And what of Howard's plays? Many
of these were written in the 1660's during his poetic apprenticeship;
none seems akin to our poem. Whereas, as shown in the Table of Allusions
below, two independent readers often agreed over the identities of many
characters in Settle's poem, Restoration readers at large were reticent
over the authorship of the <i>Reflections</i>. Hugh Macdonald, in his
useful <i>John Dryden: a Bibliography</i> (1939), was wise to follow
their example, and it seems rash, therefore, to propose any new
candidate in the face of such negative evidence. The poem exists in two
states, apparently differing only in the title page.</p>

<p class = "editor">
Evidence of Settle's authorship of <i>Absalom Senior</i>, on the other
hand, is neither wanting nor disputed. We have had to wait until our own
century for the pioneer work on this writer, since he cannot have been
considered a sufficiently major poet by Samuel Johnson's sponsors, and
Langbaine's account is sketchy. In a periodical paper<a class = "tag"
name = "tag8" href = "#note8">8</a> Macdonald summarized supplementary
evidence on the dates of composition of Settle's poem; he was working on
it in January 1681/2, and it was published on the following April 6.
Lockyer, Dean of Peterborough, asserted to Joseph Spence, who includes
the rumor in <i>Anecdotes</i>, that Settle was assisted by Clifford and
Sprat and by "several best hands of those times";<a class = "tag" name =
"tag9" href = "#note9">9</a> but Spence is notoriously unreliable. In
the lack of other evidence, then, it seems best to take the poem as
wholly Settle's. It needs only to add a few words on its textual states.
The First Edition, here reproduced, seems to exist in a single
impression, and likewise the Second Edition of the Settle (1682, in
quarto) seems to have been struck off in a single textual state. Of its
individual variants from the First Edition only the following seem of
any significance and, since there is no reason to suppose that it was
printed from any copy other than the First, they may be merely the
result of carelessness.</p>

For "No Link ... night" (p.&nbsp;35, lines 19-24), the Second Edition
substitutes, for an undetermined reason, the following:</p>

<p class = "verse inline editor">
No less the Lordly Zelecks Glory sound<br>
For courage and for Constancy renoun'd:<br>
Though once in naught but borrow'd plumes adorn'd,<br>
So much all servile Flattery he scorn'd;<br>
That though he held his Being and Support,<br>
By that weak Thread the Favour of a Court,<br>
In Sanhedrims unbrib'd, he firmly bold<br>
Durst Truth and Israels Right unmov'd uphold;<br>
In spight of Fortune, still to Honour wed,<br>

<p class = "space editor">
Very little can be said of Pordage's poem, beyond its date of
publication (January 17, 1681/2)<a class = "tag" name = "tag10" href =
"#note10">10</a> and the fact that no parallel has been found with his
earlier work. As no detailed study on him, published or unpublished, has
been traced, we can only have recourse to the standard works on the
period; data thus easily accessible are not therefore reproduced here. A
so-called second edition (MacDonald 205b) is identical with the
first.</p>

<p class = "editor">
In conclusion a few comments may be made on the general situation into
which the poems fit. It will be remembered that <i>Absalom and
Achitophel</i> appeared after the Exclusion Bill, the purpose of which
was to debar James Duke of York from the Protestant succession, had been
rejected by the House of Lords, mainly through the efforts of Halifax.
Dryden's poem was advertised on November 17, 1681, and we may safely
assume that it was published only a short time before Settle and our
other authors were hired by the Whigs to answer it. Full details have
not survived; one suspects Shaftesbury's Green Ribbon Club. That such
replies were considered necessary testifies both to the popularity of
<i>Absalom and Achitophel</i> with the layman in politics and to the
Whigs' fear of its harming their cause. Settle's was of course a
mercenary pen, and it is amusing to note that after ridiculing Halifax
here he was quite prepared to publish, fourteen years later, <i>Sacellum
Apollinare: a Funeral Poem to the Memory of that Great Statesman, George
Late Marquiss of Halifax</i>, and on this count his place among Pope's
Dunces seems merited. In tracing his quarrel with Dryden up to the
publication of <i>Absalom Senior</i>, critics have tended to overlook
the fact that by 1680 there was already hostility between the two;<a
class = "tag" name = "tag11" href = "#note11">11</a> less has been said
about the effect on Dryden of the poets themselves. The spleen of his
contributions to the Second Part of <i>Absalom and Achitophel</i> is
essentially a manufactured one and for the public entertainment;
personally he was comparatively unmoved--the Og portrait,
<span class = "facpage">vii</span>
for example, is less representative than his words in "The Epistle to
the Whigs" prefixed to <i>The Medal</i>. Here, as in <i>Mac
Flecknoe</i>, he appears to have been able to write vituperation to
order. "I have only one favor to desire of you at parting," he says, and
it is "that when you think of answering this poem, you would employ the
same pens against it, who have combated with so much success against
<i>Absalom and Achitophel</i>; for then you may assure yourselves of a
clear victory, without the least reply." Is it for the best that this
forecast proved the right one?</p>

for so you all write your selves; and indeed you are your own Heralds,
and Blazon all your Coats with <em>Honour</em> and <em>Loyalty</em> for
your <em>Supporters</em>; nay, and you are so unconscionable too in that
point, that you will allow neither of them in any other
<em>Scutcheons</em> but your own. But who has â€™em, or has â€™em not,
is not my present business; onely as you profess your selves Gentlemen,
to conjure you to give an Adversary fair play; and that if any person
whatsoever shall pretend to be aggrieved by this <span class =
"extended">POEM</span>, or any part of it, that he would bear it
patiently; since the Licentiousness of the first <em>Absolom</em> and
<em>Achitophel</em> has been the sole occasion of the Liberty of This, I
having only taken the Measure of My Weapon, from the Length of his;
which by the Rules of Honour ought not to offend you; especially, since
the boldness of that Ingenious Piece, was wholly taken from the
Encouragement you gave the Author; and â€™tis from that Boldness only
that this <span class = "extended">POEM</span> takes its Birth: for had
not his daring Pen brought that Piece into the World, I had been so far
from troubling my self in any Subject on this kind, that I may justly
say in one sence, the Writer of that <em>Absolom</em>, is the Author of
this. This favour, as in Justice due, obtainâ€™d from you, I shall not
trouble you with a long Preface, like a tedious Compliment at the Door,
but desire you to look in for your Entertainment. Onely I cannot forbear
telling you, that one thing I am a little concernâ€™d for you,
<em>Tories</em>, that your <em>Absoloms</em> and <em>Achitophels</em>,
and the rest of your Grinning Satyres against the <em>Whiggs</em>, have
this one unpardonable Fault, That the Lash is more against a
<em>David</em>, than an <em>Achitophel</em>; whilst the running down of
the <span class = "extended">PLOT</span> at so extravagant a rate,
savours of very little less (pardon the Expression) than ridiculing of
Majesty it self, and turning all those several Royal Speeches to the
Parliament on that Subject, onely into those double-tonguâ€™d Oracles
that sounded one thing, and meant another. Besides, after this
unmannerly Boldness, of not onely branding the publick Justice of the
Nation, but affronting even the Throne it self, to
<span class = "facpage">14</span>
push the humour a little farther, you run into ten times a greater Vice,
(and in the same strain too) than what you so severely inveigh against:
and whilst a <span class = "extended">POPISH PLOT</span> through want of
sufficient Circumstances, and credible Witnesses, miscarries with you, a
<span class = "extended">PROTESTANT PLOT</span> without either Witness
or Circumstance at all, goes currant. Nay you are so far now from your
former niceties and scruples, and disparing about raising of Armies, and
not one Commission found, that you can swallow the raising of a whole
Protestant <span class = "extended">ARMY</span>, without either
Commission, or Commission-Officer; Nay, the very When, Where, and How,
are no part of your Consideration. â€™Tis true, the great Cry amongst
you, is, The Nations Eyes are openâ€™d; but I am afraid, in most of you,
â€™tis onely to look where you like best: and to help your lewd
Eye-sight, you have got a damnable trick of turning the Perspective upon
occasion, and magnifying or diminishing at pleasure. But alas, all
talking to you is but impertinent, and fending and proving signifie just
nothing; for after all Arguments, both Parties are so irreconcileable,
that as the Author of <em>Absolom</em> wisely observed, theyâ€™ll be
Fools or Knaves to each other to the end of the Chapter. And therefore I
am so reasonable in this point, that should be very glad to divide â€™em
between â€™em, and give the Fool to the <em>Tory</em>, and the Knave to
the <em>Whigg</em>. For the <em>Tories</em> that will believe no <span
class = "extended">POPISH PLOT</span>, may as justly come under that
denomination, as They, that <em>David</em> tells us, <em>said in their
Hearts there was no God</em>. And then let the <em>Whiggs</em> that do
believe a <em>Popish Plot</em> be the Knaves, for daring to endeavour to
hinder the Effects of a <em>Popish Plot</em>, when the <em>Tories</em>
are resolved to the contrary. But to draw near a conclusion, I have one
favour more to beg of you, that youâ€™ll give me the freedom of clapping
but about a score of years extraordinary on the back of my
<em>Absolom</em>. Neither is it altogether so unpardonable a Poetical
License, since we find as great slips from the Author of your own
<em>Absolom</em>, where we see him bring in a <em>Zimri</em> into the
Court of <em>David</em>, who in the Scripture-story dyed by the Hand of
<em>Phineas</em> in the days of <em>Moses</em>. Nay, in the other
extream, we find him in another place talking of the Martyrdome of
<em>Stephen</em>, so many Ages after. And if so famous an Author can
forget his own Rules of Unity, Time, and Place, I hope youâ€™ll give a
Minor Poet some grains of Allowance, and he shall ever acknowledge
himself</p>

<span class = "firstletter three">I</span><span class =
"secondletter">f</span> ever anything, callâ€™d a <i>Poem</i>,
deservâ€™d a severe Reflection, that of <i>Absalom</i> and
<i>Achitophel</i> may justly contract it. For thoâ€™ Lines can never be
purgâ€™d from the dross and filth they would throw on others (there
being no retraction that can expiate the conveying of persons to an
unjust and publick reproach); yet the cleansing of their fames from a
designâ€™d pollution, may well become a more ingenious Pen than the
Author of these few reflections will presume to challenge.</p>

<p>
To epitomize which scandalous Phamphlet (unworthy the denomination of
<i>Poesy</i>) no eye can inspect it without a prodigious amazement; the
abuses being so gross and deliberate, that it seems rather a Capital or
National Libel, than personal exposures, in order to an infamous
detraction. For how does he character the King, but as a broad figure of
scandalous inclinations, or contrivâ€™d unto such irregularities, as
renders him rather the property of Parasites and Vice, than suitable to
the accomplishment of so excellent a Prince? Nay, he forces on King
<i>David</i> such a Royal resemblance, that he darkens
<span class = "facpage">56</span>
his sanctity in spite of illuminations from Holy Writ.</p>

<p>
Next (to take as near our King as he could) he calumniates the Duke of
<i>Monmouth</i> with that height of impudence, that his Sense is far
blacker than his Ink, exposing him to all the censures that a Murderer,
a Traytor, or what a Subject of most ambitious evil can possibly
comprehend: and it is some wonder, that his Lines also had not hangâ€™d
him on a Tree, to make the intended <i>Absalom</i> more compleat.</p>

<p>
As to my Lord <i>Shaftsbury</i> (in his collusive <i>Achitophel</i>),
what does he other than exceed Malice it self? or that the more prudent
deserts of that Peer were to be so impeachâ€™d before hand by his
impious Poem, as that he might be granted more emphatically condign of
the Hangmanâ€™s Ax; And which his Muse does in effect take upon her to
hasten.</p>

<p>
And if the season be well observâ€™d, when this Adulterate Poem was
spread, it will be found purposely divulgâ€™d near the time when this
Lord, with his other Noble Partner, were to be brought to their Tryals.
And I suppose this Poet thought himself enough assurâ€™d of their
condemnation; at least, that his <i>Genius</i> had not otherwise
venturâ€™d to have trampled on persons of such eminent Abilities, and
Interest in the Nation. A consideration, I confess, incited my Pen (its
preceding respect being paid to the Duke of <i>Monmouth</i>) to
vindicate their Reputations where I thought it due.</p>

<p>
<span class = "facpage">57</span>
And some are not a little mistaken in their judgments of persons, if any
Kingdom has at this time Two men of their Dignity, of more extraordinary
Understandings: Which may (if&nbsp;well considerâ€™d) be some inducement
to their future preservation and esteem. As I have endeavourâ€™d chiefly
to clear their abuse, so I have passâ€™d divers considerable persons,
under as malign inclinations of this Authorâ€™s; conceiving, that what I
have said for the Principals, may remove such smaller prejudices as are
on the value of others on the same concern.</p>

<p>
His most select and pecuniary Favourites, I have but barely touchâ€™d,
in respect his praise includes a concomitant reprehension, if well
apprehended. Besides, I was unwilling to discourage any, that for the
future may desire to be admirâ€™d by him according to their liberality.
A method, that perhaps may in time set up some Merchants of
<i>Parnassus</i>, where the <i>Indies</i> of Fame seem lately
discoverâ€™d, and may be purchasâ€™d <i>per Centum</i>, according to
modern example.</p>

<p>
As to the Character of <i>Amiel</i>, I confess my Lines are something
pointed, the one reason being, that it alludes much to a manner of
expression of this Writerâ€™s, as may be seen by the marginal Notes; and
a second will be soon allowed. The figure of <i>Amiel</i> has been so
squeezâ€™d into Paint, that his soul is seen in spite of the
Varnish.</p>

<p>
And none will deny, but it is as easie to send Truth backward, as it is
to spur Falsities egregiously forward, and might have causâ€™d any Asse,
as knowing as <i>Balaam</i>â€™s, to have rebukâ€™d such a Poet as will
needs
<span class = "facpage">58</span>
prophecy against the sense of Heaven and Men. But I have enough of this
<i>Amiell</i>, as well as of his Muse, unless that by his means it
occasions a further account. And for what is mine here, It will at worst
contract censure, in respect it is a brief reflection on a very large
Libel. And thoâ€™ I believe it did not cost (thoâ€™ that be not
offerâ€™d for an excuse) the tenth part of the time of the other. As to
my Preface, I was willing that he should find, that this smaller work
has some Nose.&mdash;Thoâ€™ I am no more bound to have my Face known by
it, than he is willing to obscure his by a Nameless Preamble.</p>

Shall not go about, either to excuse, or justifie the Publishing of this
Poem; for that would be much more an harder Task than the Writing of it:
But however, I shall say, in the words of the Author of the incomparable
<em>Absalom</em> and <em>Achitophel</em>, <em>That I am sure the Design
is honest</em>. If Wit and Fool be the Consequence of <em>Whig</em> and
<em>Tory</em>, no doubt, but Knave and Ass may be Epithets plentifully
bestowed upon me by the one party, whilst the other may grant me more
favourable ones, than perhaps I do deserve. But as very few are Judges
of Wit, so I think, much fewer of honesty; since Interest and Faction on
either side, prejudices and blinds the Judgment; and the violence of
Passion makes neither discernible in an Adversary. I know not whether my
Poem has a <em>Genius</em> to force its way against prejudice: Opinion
sways much in the World, and he that has once gained it writes securely.
I speak not this any ways to lessen the merits of an Author, whose Wit
has deservedly gained the <ins class = "mycorr" title =
"unclear">Bays</ins>; but in this I have the advantage, since, as I
desire not Glory or vain applause, I can securely wrap my self in my own
Cloud, and remain unknown, whilest he is exposed through his great
Lustre. I shall never envy what I desire not, nor am I altogether so
doting, as to believe the Issues of my own Brain to exceed all others,
and to be so very fond of them, (as&nbsp;most Authors, especially Poets,
are) as to think them without fault, or be so blinded as not to see
their blemishes, and that they are excelled by others; yet since Poems
are like Children, it may be allowed me to be naturally inclined to have
some good Opinion of my own, and not to believe this Poem altogether
despicable or ridiculous. The Ancients say, that every thing hath two
handles, I have laid hold of that opposite to the Author of
<em>Absalom</em>: As to Truth, who has the better hold, let the World
judge; and it is no new thing, for the same Persons, to be ill or well
<span class = "facpage">74</span>
represented, by several parties. I hope then, I may be excused as well
as another, since I have told my Dreams with the same Liberty, for the
fancies of Poets are no more than waking Dreams, and never imposed as
dogmatical precepts, which are more agreeable to truth or falshood, or
according to the Poets Language, which proceed from the Horny or Ivory
<ins class = "mycorr" title = "so in original: â€˜Partâ€™?">Port</ins>,
will be sentenced according to the Humour and Interest of several
Parties who in spite of our Teeth will be our judges. Where I have been
satyrical, â€™tis without Malice or Revenge; and though I brag not of my
Talent therein, I could have said much worse, of some Enemies to our
<em>Jewish</em> Heroe. He that will lash others, ought not to be angry
if the like be returned to himself: <em>Lex talionis</em> is a general
and natural Law. I call not this an Answer to <em>Absalom</em>, I have
nothing to do with him, he was a Rebel to his Father; my <em>Azaria</em>
a good Son, influenced by a worthy and Loyal Counsellor, and
<em>Achitophel</em> and <em>Hushai</em> were men of contrary Opinions,
and different Principles: And if Poets (as&nbsp;it is often brought for
their excuse, when they vary from known History) ought to represent
Persons as they ought to be, I have not transcurred the Precepts of
Poetry, and <em>Absalom</em> is not so good a Poem, because his
Character is not so agreeable to the virtue of an Heroe, as this of
<em>Azaria</em> is: But certainly when Poetry and Truth are joyned
together, and that the persons are truly what they are represented, and
livâ€™d their Character, the glory is double, both to the Heroe and the
Poet: And I could wish, that the same Hand, that drew the Rebellious
Son, with so much Ingenuity and Skill, would out do mine, in shewing the
virtues of an obedient Son and loyal Counsellor, since he may have as
much Truth for a Foundation to build upon, the Artful Structure of the
Heroes Glory, with his own Fame and Immortality.</p>

Impious Times, when Priest-craft was at height,<br>
And all the Deadly Sins esteemed light;<br>
When that Religion only was a Stale,<br>
And some bowâ€™d down to God, and some to <i>Baal</i>;<br>
When Perjury was scarce esteemâ€™d a Sin,<br>
And Vice, like flowing Tides, came rowling in;<br>
When Luxury, Debauch, and Concubine,<br>
The sad Effects of Women and of Wine,<br>
Ragâ€™d in <i>Judea</i> and <i>Jerusalem</i>,<br>
Good <i>Amazia</i> of great <i>David</i>â€™s Stem,<br>
God-like and great in Peace did rule that Land,<br>
And all the <i>Jews</i> stoopâ€™d to his just Command.<br>
Long now in <i>Sion</i> had he Peace enjoyâ€™d,<br>
After that Civil Broils the Land destroyâ€™d:<br>
Plenty and Peace attended on his Reign,<br>
And <i>Solomon</i>â€™s Golden days returnâ€™d again;<br>
When the Old <i>Canaanites</i>, who there did lurk,<br>
Began to find both God and King new Work:<br>
For <i>Amazia</i>, thoâ€™ he God did love,<br>
Had not cast out <i>Baal</i>â€™s Priests, and cut down every Grove.<br>

But Intâ€™rest, which at bottom doth remain,<br>
Which still converts all Godliness to Gain,<br>
What eâ€™er Pretence is made, is the true Cause,<br>
That moves the Priest, and like the Load-stone draws.<br>
The <i>Canaanites</i> of Old that Land possessâ€™d,<br>
And long therein Idolatry professâ€™d;<br>
Till Sins of Priests, and of the Common Rout,<br>
Causâ€™d God and his good Kings to cast them out.<br>
Their Idols were pullâ€™d down, their Groves destroyâ€™d,<br>
Strict Laws against them, and their Worship made.<br>
The Heathen Priests were banishâ€™d from the Land<br>
Of <i>Baal</i>, no Temple sufferâ€™d was to stand;<br>
And all Succeeding Kings made it their Care,<br>
They should no more rear up their Altars there.<br>
If some mild Kings did wink at their Abode,<br>
They to the <i>Jews</i> still provâ€™d a Pricking-goad:<br>
Growing more bold, they penal Laws defyâ€™d,<br>
And like tormenting Thorns, stuck in their Side.<br>
The busy Priests had lost their gainful Trade,<br>
Revenge and Malice do then Hearts invade;<br>
And since by Force they canâ€™t themselves restore,<br>
Nor gain the Sway they in <i>Judea</i> bore,<br>
With Hell they Joyn their secret Plots to bring<br>
Destruction to <i>Judea</i> and its King.</p>

These subtil Priests, in Habit black and grave;<br>
Each man a Saint in shew, in Heart a Knave,<br>
Did in <i>Judea</i> swarm, grew great withall,<br>
And like thâ€™ <i>Egyptian Frogs</i> to Court they crawl:<br>
Where, like them too, they never are at rest;<br>
But Bed and Board of Kings, with Filth infest.<br>
To every Shape they could themselves transform,<br>
Angels could seem, but still their Aim was Harm.<br>
They all the Sects among the <i>Jews</i> could ape,<br>
And went about disguissâ€™d in every Shape.<br>
One imitates the <i>Zealous Pharisee,</i><br>
The <i>Essens</i> this, the dammee <i>Sadduce</i> he;<br>
And such their ready, and their subtil Wit,<br>
For every Trade, and every Science fit:<br>
They Credit got, and stole into the Heart,<br>
And from their God, did many Souls pervert,<br>
Who seeming <i>Jews</i>, or what they were before,<br>
In Secret did the Idol <i>Baal</i> adore;<br>
Whole false Religion was but loose, and few<br>
Could bear the Righteous Strictness of the true.</p>

Thus these Disciples of the hellish Brood,<br>
Disguisâ€™d, among the <i>Jews</i>, themselves intrude,<br>

And hopâ€™d that they again should rule the State:<br>
For eâ€™er the days of good <i>Jehosaphat</i>,<br>
Through all the Land <i>Baal</i>â€™s Worship was allowâ€™d,<br>
And King and People to gross Idols bowâ€™d.<br>
The Priests, like Bloody Tyrants did command;<br>
They and their Gods, did wholly rule the Land;<br>
And every one who would not bow to <i>Baal</i>,<br>
Fled thence, or else by Fire, or Sword did fall:<br>

Their Idols, and their Groves he quite destroyâ€™d;<br>

Who for a space, set Idols up again,<br>
Tormenting those to Death who would not turn,<br>
And did the <i>Jewish Rabbins</i> slay or burn)<br>
These crafty Priests, by Plots did never cease,<br>
To spoil the Beauty of <i>Judeaâ€™s</i> Peace.<br>
Whilst <i>Joash</i> reignâ€™d, by sly and subtil Arts,<br>
They first estrangâ€™d from him his Peoples Hearts.<br>
Saw Factionâ€™s Sparks, and unseen blew the Fire,<br>
Till Rebells â€™gainst that good King did conspire:<br>
Then Cursed <i>Zabed</i> of proud <i>Ammon</i>â€™s Line,<br>
And <i>Moabitish Jehozabad</i> joyn,<br>
And to their Side some <i>Pharisees</i> they drew,<br>
(<i>Joash</i> did to their Sect no Favor shew)<br>
And thâ€™ <i>Essens</i>, who then daily numerous grew,<br>
Rebell, and their good King, like Murtherers, slew.<br>
Then <i>Amazia</i> over <i>Jordan</i> fled,<br>
Till God had struck the Tyrant <i>Zabed</i> dead;<br>
When all his Subjects, who his Fate did moan,<br>
With joyful Hearts, restorâ€™d him to his Throne;<br>
Who then his Fatherâ€™s Murtherers destroyâ€™d,<br>
And a long, happy, peaceful Reign enjoyâ€™d.<br>
Belovâ€™d of all, for merciful was He,<br>
Like God, in the Superlative Degree.<br>
The <i>Jewish</i> Sects he did not seek to quell,<br>
Yet Laws he made they might no more rebell:<br>
Wisely about them made of Laws a Fence,<br>
Yet kind, would not oppress their Conscience.<br>
The <i>Pharisee</i>, a very numerous Sect,<br>
Above the rest were in their Worship strict:<br>
In their own <i>Synagogues</i> he let them pray,<br>
And worship God after their stricter way.<br>
In Peace all livâ€™d, and former strife forgot,<br>
The <i>Chemarims</i> and Hell had hatchâ€™d a Plot:<br>
A Plot formâ€™d in the deep Abyss below,<br>
Law and Religion both to overthrow.<br>
The King was by their Bloody Swords to fall,<br>
That all <i>Judea</i> might submit <i>to Baal</i>.<br>

Great were their Hopes, and deep was their Design.<br>
The Train already laid to spring their Mine;<br>
Not dreaming Heavâ€™n could their Plots betray,<br>
They only waited an auspicious day.<br>
Nor failâ€™d their Plot for want of Common Sence,<br>
As some endeavorâ€™d to persuade the Prince:<br>
For with much Art, great Industry and Care,<br>
They all things for their black Design prepare.<br>
Not hatchâ€™d by Common Brains, or men of Earth,<br>
Nor wasâ€™t the Issue of a suddain Birth;<br>
But long designing, and well laid it seems,<br>
By <i>Baal</i>â€™s <i>Arch-priests</i>, and subtil <i>Chemarins</i>.<br>

The <i>Canaanites</i> dispersed through the Land,<br>
Oâ€™er whom <i>Baal</i>â€™s Priests had absolute Command,<br>
Were bound with Oaths, the Priests Religious Charms,<br>

They thought by Bloud to give the Kingdom ease;<br>
Physickâ€™d the <i>Jews</i> when they had no Disease.<br>
Contingent mischiefs these did not foresee,<br>
Against their Conscience fought, and Godâ€™s Decree.<br>
What shall we think, when such, pretending good,<br>
Would build the Nations Peace on Innocent Blood?<br>
These would expose the People to the Sword<br>
Of each unbounded Arbitrary Lord.<br>
<span class = "facpage">105</span>
<span class = "pagenum">[31]</span>
But their good Laws, by which they Right enjoy,<br>
The King nor could, nor ever would destroy.<br>
And tho he Judge be of whatâ€™s fit and just,<br>
He ownâ€™d from Heaven, and from Man a Trust.<br>
Tho Laws to Kingly Power be a Band,<br>
They are not Slaves to those whom they command.<br>
The Power that God at first to <i>Adam</i> gave,<br>
Was different far from what all Kings now have:<br>
He had no Law but Will; but all Kings now<br>
Are bound by Laws, as all Examples show.<br>
By Laws Kings first were made, and with intent<br>
Men to defend, by Heavâ€™nâ€™s and Manâ€™s consent.<br>
God to the Crown the Regal Power did bring,<br>
And by Consent at first, Men chose their King.<br>
If Kings usurpâ€™d a Power, by force did sway,<br>
The People by no Law were bound tâ€™obey.<br>
This does not in the People place a Right<br>
To dissolve Soveraign sway by force or might.<br>
To Kings, by long succession, there is givâ€™n<br>
A native Right unto the Throne, by Heavâ€™n:<br>
Who may not be run down by common Cry,<br>
For Vice, Oppression, and for Tyranny.<br>
But if that Kings the tyes of Laws do break,<br>
The People, without fault, have leave to speak;<br>
To shew their Grievances, and seek redress<br>
By lawful means, when Kings and Lords oppress.<br>
Tho they canâ€™t give and take, wheneâ€™r they please,<br>
And Kings allowâ€™d to be Godâ€™s Images.<br>
The Government you Tyranny must call,<br>
Where Subjects have no Right, and Kings have all.<br>
But if reciprocal a Right there be,<br>
Derived down unto Posteritie,<br>
That sideâ€™s in fault, who thâ€™other doth invade,<br>
By which soeâ€™r at first the breach is made:<br>
For Innovation is a dangerous thing,<br>
Whether it comes from People or from King.<br>
To change Foundations which long Ages stood,<br>
Which have provâ€™d firm, unshaken, sound, and good,<br>
To pull all down, and cast the Frame anew,<br>
Is work for Rebels, and for Tyrants too.</p>

Now what relief could <i>Amazia</i> bring,<br>
Fatal indeed to be too good a King?<br>
Friends he had many, but them did not know,<br>
Or else made to believe they were not so:<br>
For all that did ill Ministers oppose,<br>
Were represented to him as his Foes.<br>
Yet there were many thousands in those days,<br>
Who <i>Amazia</i> did both love and praise;<br>
Who for him daily prayâ€™d, and wishâ€™d his good,<br>
And for him would have spent both Coin and Bloud.<br>
Yet these, tho the more numerous, and the best,<br>
Were callâ€™d but murmuring Traytors by the rest:<br>
By such who strainâ€™d till they had crackt the string<br>
Of Government; lovâ€™d Powâ€™r, and not the King<br>
These daily hightned <i>Amazia</i>â€™s fears,<br>
And thus they whisperâ€™d to his Royal Ears:</p>

<p class = "verse">
Sir, it is time you now take up the Sword,<br>
And let your Subjects know you are their Lord.<br>
Goodness by Rebels wonâ€™t be understood,<br>
And you are much too wonderful and good.<br>
The <i>Jews</i>, a moody, murmuring, stubborn Race,<br>
Grow worse by Favours, and rebel with Grace.<br>
Pamperâ€™d they are, grown rich and fat with ease,<br>
Whom no good Monarch long could ever please.<br>
Freedom and Liberty pretend to want;<br>
Thatâ€™s still the cry, where theyâ€™re on Mischief bent.<br>
Freedom is their Disease; and had they less,<br>
They would not be so ready to transgress.<br>
Give them but Liberty, let them alone,<br>
They shall not onely you, but God dethrone.<br>
Remember, Sir, how your good Father fell;<br>
It was his goodness made them first rebel.<br>
And now the very self-same tract they tread,<br>
To reach your Crown, and then take off your head.<br>
A senseless Plot they stumblâ€™d on, or made,<br>
To make you of thâ€™old <i>Canaanites</i> afraid.<br>
Still when they mean the Nation to enthral,<br>
With heavie Clamour they cry out on <i>Baal</i>.<br>
<span class = "facpage">107</span>
<span class = "pagenum">[33]</span>
But these hot Zealots who <i>Baal</i>â€™s Idols curse,<br>
Bow to their own more ugly far and worse.<br>
<i>Baal</i> would but rob some Jewels from your Crown,<br>
But these would Monarchy itself pull down:<br>
Both Church and State theyâ€™l not reform by Halves,<br>
Pull down the Temple, and set up their Calves.<br>
You, and your Priests, they would turn out to Graze,<br>
Nor would they let you smell a Sacrifize,<br>
Those pious Offerings which Priests lasie made,<br>
To Rebels, should, instead of God be paid.<br>
How to the Prey these factious <i>Jews</i> do run!<br>
From you by art they have <ins class = "mycorr"

That little subtle Instrument of Hell,<br>
Worse than to <i>David</i> was <i>Achitophel</i>,<br>
The young Man tutors, sends him through the Land,<br>
That he the peoples minds may understand;<br>
That he, with winning Charms, might court the <i>Jew</i>,<br>
And draw your fickle Subjects hearts from you.<br>
Alas! already they of you Complain.<br>
And are grown sick of your too peaceful Reign,<br>
Their Lusts grown high, they are debauchâ€™d with Grace,<br>
And like unfrozen Snakes fly in your Face.<br>
These men who now pretend to give you Law,<br>
Stood of the Tyrant <i>Zabed</i>â€™s power in awe;<br>
He made them crouch who scornâ€™d a Princeâ€™s sway,<br>
And forcâ€™d them, like dull slaves, his power obey.<br>
Of <i>Israel</i>, and of <i>Juda</i>â€™s Tribe you spring,<br>
A Lion is the Ensign of a King,<br>
Rouse up your self, in mildness sleep no more,<br>
And make them tremble at your princely roar:<br>
Appear like <i>Jove</i> with Thunder in your hand,<br>
And let the Slaves your power understand;<br>
Strike but the sinning Princes Down to Hell,<br>
The rest will worship you, and neâ€™r rebel.</p>

But these with Art did dangers represent,<br>
And Plots they framâ€™d the People never meant.<br>
Each Mole hill they a Mountain did create,<br>
And sought to fright him with his Fathers Fate.<br>
<i>Hushai</i> at last was to a Prison sent,<br>
As a false Traitor to the Government.<br>
Loud murmurs then possest the troubled <i>Jews</i>,<br>
Who were surprised at the fatal News;<br>
His Wisdom they believed their chief support,<br>
Against the evil Instruments at Court;<br>
Nor, by his Actions, did they ever find,<br>
He bore a Traitâ€™rous, or a factious Mind:<br>
And now they thought themselves exposâ€™d to all<br>
The Arts, and Plots of the hid friends to <i>Baal</i>.<br>
Troubled, and discontented, at the last,<br>
Their Eyes upon the noble Prince they cast.<br>
Who fearing lest their discontent and rage,<br>
Should them, to some rebellious Crime ingage,<br>
Both for his Fathers, and his Countries sake,<br>
The murmuring People sought more calm to make.<br>
With a sweet Air, and with a graceful look,<br>
He did command their silence, eâ€™er he spoke.<br>
Then thus he said, and though his words were few,<br>
They fell like Manna, or the Hony Dew;</p>

My Country-men, Let not your discontent<br>

For heâ€™s so merciful, so good, so just,<br>
That he of no mans Life will make a Prey,<br>
Or take it in an Arbitrary way,<br>

In humble wise, to shew the King their Grief,<br>
And on their bended Knees to seek Relief.<br>

Then to the King, the Loyal <i>Nashon</i> said.<br>
Great Sir, whom all good Subjects truly Love,<br>
Tho all things that you do they canâ€™t approve,<br>
We, whom the Throne has with high Honours blest,<br>
Present you here the prayers of the rest;<br>
Our bended Knees, as low as Earth we bow,<br>

The blessing of your Love to us restore,<br>
And raise us to your Favour, Sir, once more.<br>
Where is the Joy, the Peace, and Quiet flown,<br>
All had, when first you did ascend the Throne;<br>
Now murmuring discontents assault our Ears,<br>
And loud Complaints of jealousies, and fears:<br>
Bad instruments help to blow up this Fire,<br>
And with ill minds, their own worse Arts admire,<br>
Whilst, by their means, you think your Friends your Foes,<br>
For your best friends, your Enemies suppose;<br>
Suspect your Loyal Subjects, and believe<br>
The <i>Sanhedrim</i> would you of Rights bereive.<br>
Your people, who do love your gentle Sway,<br>
And willingly their God, and you obey,<br>
Who for Religion ever zealous were,<br>
For that, for you, and for themselves do fear.<br>
Clear as the Sun, by sad effects they find,<br>
A <i>Baalite</i> to succeed you is designâ€™d:<br>
Sir, they would not dispute with you, his right,<br>
But they can nâ€™re indure a <i>Baalite</i>:<br>
Tho whilst you live, they are secure and blest,<br>
Yet are they with a thousand fears opprest,<br>
Think your Life still in danger of the Plot,<br>
Which now is laughâ€™d at, and almost forgot.<br>

And on the <i>Pharisees</i> a false one thrown;<br>
Your zealous faithful <i>Jews</i> all Rebels made,<br>

And to secure our fears, that after you,<br>
None shall succeed but a believing <i>Jew</i>.<br>
Sir, this is all your Loyal Subjects Crave,<br>
On you, as on a God, they cry to save.<br>
Kings are like Gods on Earth, when they redress,<br>
Their peoples Griefs, and save them in distress.<br>
With loads of careful thoughts, the King opprest,<br>
And long revolving in his Royal Breast,<br>
Thâ€™ event of Things&mdash;&mdash;at last he silence broke,<br>
And, with an awful Majesty, he spoke.<br>
Iâ€™ve long in Peace <i>Judeas</i> Scepter swaid,<br>

Which should exceed, my Mercy or their Love:<br>
Who, till of late, more ready were to give<br>
Supplies to me, than I was to receive.<br>
Oh! happy days, and oh! unhappy change;<br>
That makes my <i>Sanhedrims</i>, and my people strange,<br>
And now, when I am in the Throne grown old,<br>
With grief I see my Subjects Love prove cold.<br>
They fear not my known Mercy to offend,<br>
And with my awful Justice dare contend;<br>
But yet their Crimes my mercy shanâ€™t asswage,<br>
Iâ€™m ready to forgive thâ€™ offending Age,<br>
And though they should my Kingly power slight,<br>
Iâ€™le still keep for them my forgiving right.<br>
I feel a tenderness within me spring,<br>
I am my Peoples Father, and their King,<br>
And tho I think, they may have done me wrong.<br>
I canâ€™t remember their offences long.<br>
Nature is movâ€™d, and sues for a Reprieve,<br>
They are my Children, and I must forgive.<br>
My many jealous fears I shanâ€™t repeat,<br>
My Heart with a strong pulse of Love doth beat;<br>

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project

your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with

opportunities to fix the problem.

If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any

or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
